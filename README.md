First Draft: 
![website draft1](assets/drafts/Draft1-Mar2019.png)

While not bad, I wasn't very satisfied with the layout of the images as I didn't use grid or flexbox, which resulted in it not translating well over different browser sizes. Also, I wanted to learn more about animation in css so I plan for the next draft to be laid out better as well as have some more interesting animations than the flashing texts.
